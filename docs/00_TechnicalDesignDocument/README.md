## Introduction

### Rationale

#### What are you trying to accomplish?

- create a platform for mechanical keyboard enthusiasts to share their creations and its specifications
- [pcpartpicker.com](https://pcpartpicker.com) but for mechanical keyboards
- mechanical keyboard market for users to buy, sell and trade from each other
- easily lookup a mechanical keyboard's specifications from its switches, to case, to keycaps, etc.
- easily find which vendor sells those said specfication items

#### What's wrong with things the way they are now?

- my brother and his friend builds custom mechanical keyboards
- I ask too many times where I can order parts for a build I want but takes too much time to find an online store, etc.
- if only there's a way I can plan my new mechanical keyboard build like [pcpartpicker.com](https://pcpartpicker.com), this process would be easier

### Background

Building a custom mechanical keyboard is fun. Unfortunately, ordering those individual parts is not a fun task.

One has to do a great amount of researching and networking on various sites, forums and private group chats to gather up all the required parts in building a custom mechanical keyboard.

For those who are trying to build their first custom mechanical keyboard, they have to initially invest a great of amount of time looking for online stores, let alone finding one that would ship to their country in an affordable fee.
