## Client

The application's client-side should be technically designed like a social media platform like [reddit.com](https://reddit.com) and [pcpartpicker.com](https://pcpartpicker.com). The key idea is that users will be able to create and share content with others.

A single-page application with server-side rendering capabilities will allow the application to be dynamic, extendable and shareable.

The application should have PWA functionalities so users can use it regardless of what device they are using. This is not a priority and working on features for the first release should be the main focus.
